        <p>Contributing to open source project like NavCoin can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.</p>
        <p>Why do people contribute to NavCoin? Plenty of reasons!<p>
        
        <h3>Improve existing skills</h3>
        <p>Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you in NavCoin and all its related projects.</p>
        
        <h3>Meet people who are interested in similar things</h3>
        <p>NavCoin is a project a with warm, welcoming community that has kept people coming back for years. Many people form have formed lifelong friendships through their participation in NavCoin, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.</p>
        
        <h3>Find mentors and teach others</h3>
        <p>Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.</p>
        
        <h3>Building public artifacts in the blockchain space will help you grow a reputation (and a career)</h3>
        <p>By definition, all of your NavCoin work is open source work and public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.</p>
        
        <h3>Learn people skills</h3>
        <p>NavCoin's open source nature offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.</p>
        
        <h3>It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones</h3>
        <p>You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in NavCoin. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? In NavCoin, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.</p>

            If you’re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you get involved? What if you don’t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?
        </p>
               
        <p>Not to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with NavCoin's open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience.</p>
        
        <h3>You don’t have to contribute code</h3>
        <p>A common misconception about contributing to NavCoin is that you need to contribute code. Actually, the other parts of a project that are most overlooked. You can do NavCoin a huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!</p> 
        
        <p>Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project.</p>
       
       
        <h3>Do you like planning events?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Organize workshops or meetups about the project, like @fzamperin did for NodeSchool</li>
            <li>Organize the project’s conference (if they have one)</li>
            <li>Help community members find the right conferences and submit proposals for speaking</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Do you like to design?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Restructure layouts to improve the project’s usability</li>
            <li>Conduct user research to reorganize and refine the project’s navigation or menus.</li>
            <li>Put together a style guide to help the project have a consistent visual design</li>
            <li> Create art for t-shirts or a new logo, like hapi.js’s contributors did</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Do you like to write?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Write and improve the project’s documentation</li>
            <li>Curate a folder of examples showing how the project is used</li>
            <li>Start a newsletter for the project, or curate highlights from the mailing list</li>
            <li>Write tutorials for the project, like PyPA’s contributors did</li>
            <li>Write a translation for the NavCoin and its documentation</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Do you like to code?</h3>
         <ul>
             <li>Find an open issue to tackle, like @dianjin did for Leaflet</li>
             <li>Ask if you can help write a new feature</li>
             <li>Automate project setup</li>
             <li>Improve tooling and testing/li>
             <li>Build your own level two app on top of NavCoin, like @prodpak and @sakdienx did</li>
         </ul>
         
                 
        <h3>Do you like helping people?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Answer questions about the project on Discord or Reddit</li>
            <li>Answer questions for people on open issues</li>
            <li>Help moderate the discussion boards or conversation channels</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Do you like helping people?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Review code on other people’s submissions</li>
            <li>Write tutorials for how a project can be used</li>
            <li>Offer to mentor another contributor, like @ereichert did for @bronzdoc on Rust</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>You don’t just have to work on software projects!</h3>
        <p>While NavCoin is a software heavy project, you can collaborate on just about anything. There is merchant adoption, promotion, books, lists, and classes that can get developed to help NavCoin.</P
        <p>Even if you’re a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It’s often less intimidating to work on projects that don’t involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.</p>

        <p>If you go to an issue tracker and things seem confusing, it’s not just you. These tools require a lot of implicit knowledge, but people can help you navigate it and you can ask them questions.</p>

        <p>For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to NavCoin is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely.</p>
        <p>Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.</p>
        
        <h3>Anatomy of the NavCoin open source project</h3>
        <p>Every open source community is different.</p>
        
        <p>Spending years on one open source project means you’ve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.</p>
        
        <p>That said, NavCoin operates simlar to  many open source projects with a few key differances. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to NavCoin.
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Author:</strong> Generally this is the person/s or organization that created the project, But NavCoin is different in the fact that there is not author. </li>
             <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Again this is  generally a person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository. But NavCoin is completely owned byt the community. </li>
             <li><strong>Maintainers:</strong> Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)</li>
             <li><strong>Contributors:</strong> Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.</li>
              <li><strong>Community Members:</strong> People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.</li>
        </ul>

            You have decided to help out, and you’re ready to make a contribution. Finally! Here’s how to get your contribution in the right way.
        </p>
    
        
        <p>Whether you’re a one-time contributor or trying to join the NavCoin community, working with others is one of the most important skills you’ll develop when contributing to NavCoin.</p>

        <p>[As a new contributor,] I quickly realized I had to ask questions if I wanted to be able to close the issue. I skimmed through the code base. Once I had some sense of what was going on, I asked for more direction. And voilà! I was able to solve the issue after getting all the relevant details I needed.</p>

    <div style="text-align:left; max-width: 700px; margin:0 auto;"> 
        <p>Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help your ideas come across effectively.</p>
        
        <p>Give context. Help others get quickly up to speed. If you’re running into an error, explain what you’re trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you’re suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it’d be useful to the project (not just to you!)</p>
        
        <p>😇 “X doesn’t happen when I do Y”</p>
        
        <p>😢 “X is broken! Please fix it.”</p>
        
        <p>Do your homework beforehand. It’s OK not to know things, but show that you tried. Before asking for help, be sure to check a project’s README, documentation, issues (open or closed), mailing list, and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate when you demonstrate that you’re trying to learn.</p>
        
        <p>😇 “I’m not sure how to implement X. I checked the help docs and didn’t find any mentions.”</p>
        
        <p>😢 “How do I X?”</p>
        
        <p>Keep requests short and direct. Much like sending an email, every contribution, no matter how simple or helpful, requires someone else’s review. Many projects have more incoming requests than people available to help. Be concise. You will increase the chance that someone will be able to help you.</p>
        
        <p>😇 “I’d like to write an API tutorial.”</p>
        
        <p>😢 “I was driving down the highway the other day and stopped for gas, and then I had this amazing idea for something we should be doing, but before I explain that, let me show you…“</p>
        
        <p>Keep all communication public. Although it’s tempting, don’t reach out to maintainers privately unless you need to share sensitive information (such as a security issue or serious conduct violation). When you keep the conversation public, more people can learn and benefit from your exchange. Discussions can be, in themselves, contributions.</p>
        
        <p>😇 (as a comment) “@-maintainer Hi there! How should we proceed on this PR?”</p>
        
        <p>😢 (as an email) “Hey there, sorry to bother you over email, but I was wondering if you’ve had a chance to review my PR”</p>
                
        <p>It’s okay to ask questions (but be patient!). Everybody was new to the project at some point, and even experienced contributors need to get up to speed when they look at a new project. By the same token, even longtime maintainers are not always familiar with every part of the project. Show them the same patience that you’d want them to show to you.</p>
        
        <p>😇 “Thanks for looking into this error. I followed your suggestions. Here’s the output.”</p>
        
        <p>😢 “Why can’t you fix my problem? Isn’t this your project?”</p>
        
        <p>Respect community decisions. Your ideas may differ from the community’s priorities or vision. They may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for compromise, maintainers have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with their direction, you can always work on your own fork or start your own project.</p>
        
        <p>😇 “I’m disappointed you can’t support my use case, but as you’ve explained it only affects a minor portion of users, I understand why. Thanks for listening.”</p>
        
        <p>😢 “Why won’t you support my use case? This is unacceptable!”</p>
        
        <p>Above all, keep it classy. Open source is made up of collaborators from all over the world. Context gets lost across languages, cultures, geographies, and time zones. In addition, written communication makes it harder to convey a tone or mood. Assume good intentions in these conversations. It’s fine to politely push back on an idea, ask for more context, or further clarify your position. Just try to leave the internet a better place than when you found it.</p>
        
        <h3>Gathering context</h3>
        <p>Before doing anything, do a quick check to make sure your idea hasn’t been discussed elsewhere. Skim the project’s README, issues (open and closed), mailing list, and Stack Overflow. You don’t have to spend hours going through everything, but a quick search for a few key terms goes a long way.</p>
        
        <p>If you can’t find your idea elsewhere, you’re ready to make a move. If the project is on GitHub, you’ll likely communicate by opening an issue or pull request:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Issues are like starting a conversation or discussion</li>
            <li>Pull requests are for starting work on a solution</li>
            <li>For lightweight communication, such as a clarifying or how-to question, try asking on Stack Overflow, IRC, Slack, or other chat channels, if the project has one</li>
            <li>Before you open an issue or pull request, check the project’s contributing docs (usually a file called CONTRIBUTING, or in the README), to see whether you need to include anything specific. For example, they may ask that you follow a template, or require that you use tests.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>If you want to make a substantial contribution, open an issue to ask before working on it. It’s helpful to watch the project for a while (on GitHub, you can click “Watch” to be notified of all conversations), and get to know community members, before doing work that might not get accepted.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Opening an issue</h3>
        <p>You should usually open an issue in the following situations:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Report an error you can’t solve yourself</li>
            <li>Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)</li>
            <li>Propose a new feature or other project idea</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Tips for communicating on issues:</p>
        If you see an open issue that you want to tackle, comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
        If an issue was opened a while ago, it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
        If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.
        Opening a pull request
        You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:
        
        Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
        Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in an issue
        A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
        
        If the project is on GitHub, here’s how to submit a pull request:
        
        Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions here.)
        Create a branch for your edits.
        Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, “Closes #37.”)
        Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
        Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
        Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
        If this is your first pull request, check out Make a Pull Request, which @kentcdodds created as a walkthrough video tutorial. You can also practice making a pull request in the First Contributions repository, created by @Roshanjossey.
