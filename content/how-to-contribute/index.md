        <p>Contributing to open source project like NavCoin can be a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill you can imagine.</p>
        <p>Why do people contribute to NavCoin? Plenty of reasons!<p>
        
        <h3>Improve existing skills</h3>
        <p>Whether it’s coding, user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing, if you’re looking for practice, there’s a task for you in NavCoin and all its related projects.</p>
        
        <h3>Meet people who are interested in similar things</h3>
        <p>NavCoin is a project a with warm, welcoming community that has kept people coming back for years. Many people form have formed lifelong friendships through their participation in NavCoin, whether it’s running into each other at conferences or late night online chats about burritos.</p>
        
        <h3>Find mentors and teach others</h3>
        <p>Working with others on a shared project means you’ll have to explain how you do things, as well as ask other people for help. The acts of learning and teaching can be a fulfilling activity for everyone involved.</p>
        
        <h3>Building public artifacts in the blockchain space will help you grow a reputation (and a career)</h3>
        <p>By definition, all of your NavCoin work is open source work and public, which means you get free examples to take anywhere as a demonstration of what you can do.</p>
        
        <h3>Learn people skills</h3>
        <p>NavCoin's open source nature offers opportunities to practice leadership and management skills, such as resolving conflicts, organizing teams of people, and prioritizing work.</p>
        
        <h3>It’s empowering to be able to make changes, even small ones</h3>
        <p>You don’t have to become a lifelong contributor to enjoy participating in NavCoin. Have you ever seen a typo on a website, and wished someone would fix it? In NavCoin, you can do just that. Open source helps people feel agency over their lives and how they experience the world, and that in itself is gratifying.</p>

            If you’re a new open source contributor, the process can be intimidating. How do you get involved? What if you don’t know how to code? What if something goes wrong?
        </p>
               
        <p>Not to worry! There are all sorts of ways to get involved with NavCoin's open source project, and a few tips will help you get the most out of your experience.</p>
        
        <h3>You don’t have to contribute code</h3>
        <p>A common misconception about contributing to NavCoin is that you need to contribute code. Actually, the other parts of a project that are most overlooked. You can do NavCoin a huge favor by offering to pitch in with these types of contributions!</p> 
        
        <p>Even if you like to write code, other types of contributions are a great way to get involved with a project and meet other community members. Building those relationships will give you opportunities to work on other parts of the project.</p>

            <li> - Conduct user research to reorganize and refine the project’s navigation or menus.</li>
            <li> - Put together a style guide to help the project have a consistent visual design</li>
            <li> - Create art for t-shirts or a new logo, like hapi.js’s contributors did</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Do you like to write?</h3>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Do you like to code?</h3>

             <li> - Ask if you can help write a new feature</li>
             <li> - Automate project setup</li>
             <li> - Improve tooling and testing/li>
             <li> - Build your own level two app on top of NavCoin, like @prodpak and @sakdienx did</li>
         </ul>
         
                 
        <h3>Do you like helping people?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> - Answer questions about the project on Discord or Reddit</li>
            <li> - Answer questions for people on open issues</li>

        <h3>You don’t just have to work on software projects!</h3>
        <p>While NavCoin is a software heavy project, you can collaborate on just about anything. There is merchant adoption, promotion, books, lists, and classes that can get developed to help NavCoin.</P
        <p>Even if you’re a software developer, working on a documentation project can help you get started in open source. It’s often less intimidating to work on projects that don’t involve code, and the process of collaboration will build your confidence and experience.</p>

        <p>If you go to an issue tracker and things seem confusing, it’s not just you. These tools require a lot of implicit knowledge, but people can help you navigate it and you can ask them questions.</p>

        <p>For anything more than a typo fix, contributing to NavCoin is like walking up to a group of strangers at a party. If you start talking about llamas, while they were deep in a discussion about goldfish, they’ll probably look at you a little strangely.</p>
        <p>Before jumping in blindly with your own suggestions, start by learning how to read the room. Doing so increases the chances that your ideas will be noticed and heard.</p>
        
        <h3>Anatomy of the NavCoin open source project</h3>
        <p>Every open source community is different.</p>
        
        <p>Spending years on one open source project means you’ve gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.</p>
        
        <p>That said, NavCoin operates simlar to  many open source projects with a few key differances. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to NavCoin.
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Author:</strong> Generally this is the person/s or organization that created the project, But NavCoin is different in the fact that there is not author. </li>
             <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Again this is  generally a person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository. But NavCoin is completely owned byt the community. </li>
             Maintainers: Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
             Contributors: Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
             Community Members: People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project’s direction.
        </ul>

    <p>NavCoin and its associated projects are security software that help protect assets worth millions of dollars, so every code change needs to be reviewed by experienced developers. It can take a long time for other developers to review your pull requests. Remember that all reviewers are taking time away from their own projects to review your pull requests, so be patient and respectful of their time.</p>

    <p>Please also consider helping to review other people’s pull requests. You don’t need to be an expert in NavCoin, the NavCoin Core codebase, or C++ (although all these things help). There are almost always open pull requests that any programmer can review.</p>

    <p>Do you want to begin coding for NavCoin but don’t have a specific improvement in mind? Here are a few ideas:</p>
    <h3>Fix existing issues</h3>
    <p>The issue tracker for each repository is the best place to find a useful way to contribute to NavCoin. Before starting to write any patches for issues you find, you may want to comment on the issue to make sure nobody else is already working on it.</p>
    <h3>Write tests</h3>
    <p>NavCoin’s various softwares are covered by many tests, but patches that improve test coverage are always welcome and are a great way to build familiarity with the codebase. See the documentation about automated testing.</p>
