After almost a year and a half since the first conversations started and the initial proposal was made, NavCoin Core v4.4.0 is now available for download introducing the latest modifications for the Community Fund to be fully functional. It is important to start by thanking all the support and patience received during the months that the testing phase lasted.

Technically this release can also be considered the most advanced and complex to date NavCoin has had. We have incorporated new testing routines into our usual development process, which will help make future releases more secure than ever. It has also allowed our development team to learn and understand the insides of NavCoin Core to an exponentially deeper degree in a short amount of time. We have built new connections and incorporated new faces to <a href="/for-developers/#contributor-list">our list of contributors</a>. Huge thanks to all of them too, this is just the beginning.

This launch is the result of a long process of consensus in the community. The first decisions were related to something as simple (but important) as if this development was going to be done or not, or decide what would be the amount contributed to the fund and where those coins would be taken from.

It will also be the consensus among the members of the network what will determine if the implementation ends up being a success or not. Now more than ever, NavCoin and its future is in the hands of its community.

Throughout the design process, we have been very careful so that the system is protected against malicious actors who want to extract funds without the tasks being completed and we have tried to adjust the levels so that a proposal is easily accepted and does not fall into blocking.

But it is important to point out that the ultimate responsibility rests with you. To make NavCoin stronger, it is imperative that your coins are in a node that you control and stake. Leaving them in third-party wallets (such as exchanges or staking pools) allows external actors to concentrate power and manipulate the result of the votes.

You are free to participate in the degree you want in this process, creating proposals, voting or simply expressing your opinion about them, but remember that the higher the percentage of participation, the higher the level of decentralization we will achieve. In the coming weeks we will publish different tools to facilitate the process of creating proposals, as well as their voting, follow-up or discussion.

Your rights as a member of the network are now extended. Exercising them is important.

We can not wait to see the incredible proposals that the community will make and the positive effects that this level of power redistribution will bring to NavCoin.
